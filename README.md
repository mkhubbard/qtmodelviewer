## Ogre3D Mesh Viewer in Qt4

**NOTE: This code is published for archival purposes and is not maintained. Do not used in production.**

This was a small project I worked on over the course of a few weeks to keep up to date with C++ and play around with Ogre3D. The intent of the application is to provide a tool for viewing 3D meshes used by the Ogre3D engine. A video demonstrating the version of the application I wrote using wxWidgets is available here: http://youtu.be/Xpmbpp9owsY

I later ported the code to the Qt framework and expanded it a little by adding animation support and playback controls.
